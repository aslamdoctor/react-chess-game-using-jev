# React Chess with Jev AI Advisor

A chess web app built with React and Redux Toolkit. Player 1 plays White against a computer opponent on Black. On White's turn, an AI advisor evaluates legal moves using TypeSafe's Jev model and displays decision stats in a side panel.

## How It Works

- Player 1 (White): Human player move selection, with suggestions from the Jev advisor.
- Player 2 (Black): Automated computer opponent that evaluates board moves.
- Advisor panel: Displays the recommended move, decision confidence, candidate move probability distribution, material balance, and API response time.
